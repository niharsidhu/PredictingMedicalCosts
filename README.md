# PredictingMedicalCosts
Project for ORIE 4741 by Nihar Sidhu (ns625) and Nehal Rawat (nr338)

Our project uses the The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) Hospital Inpatient Discharges dataset to predict medical costs for patients in NY state hospitals. Specifically, we focused our problem to looking at cases of chest pain in the Bronx. Chest pain is one of the #1 leading causes of hospital admission, and Bronx has the lowest income per capita in New York State. We hope that our data and findings can help the Health Departments realize the underlying factors that make hospital bills so expensive, and thus take action to reducing the costs.

ORIE 4741 - Final Report: This is our final report. Here we discuss our findings.

OverallDataScripting.ipynb - All work was done in Julia. Here you can find our methods regarding data cleaning, summary statistics, training, and testing models, and more. I hope to come back to this file to make it more reader friendly.

Future Improvements - This was our first data science project and we are always excited and open to comments and suggestions.
One improvement that I want to work on is expanding our findings to include more diseases, and more counties of New York State.

The original dataset is too large to be stored on GitHub. However, it can be found here: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/82xm-y6g8
